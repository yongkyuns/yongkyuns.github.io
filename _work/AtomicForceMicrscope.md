[Atomic force micrscope (AFM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_force_microscopy)
is an industrial and scientific instrumentation for 3D scanning of nano-meter
sized objects. In my first job, I worked as a systems engineer for a couple years 
at [Park Systems](https://www.parksystems.com/) to design controllers for the 
stage and actuators which are used in these devices. Nothing really works as 
cleanly at this small scale, so a lot of attention is put into system 
characterization, noise-supression and decoupling of multi-axes actuators.
