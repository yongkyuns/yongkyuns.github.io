[Noon](https://github.com/yongkyuns/noon) is a Rust library for 
generating 2D animations with simple declarative-style commands.  

A while ago, I came across [manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim),
which was used by the author to 
[make educational videos about math](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown).
I obviously enjoyed the videos, but I was also very impressed by the 
effectiveness of the animated visual contents. I was learning Rust at the
time, so it only made sense to apply my learning in a project of my 
own :wink:. For more details, take a look at 
[READEME](https://github.com/yongkyuns/noon).
