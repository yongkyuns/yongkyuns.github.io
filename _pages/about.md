Hi! Thanks for dropping by :wave:  
  
I'm an engineer with love for building things and solving problems. 
For most of my career, I've worked on solving robotics and controls
problems in the automotive domain, ranging from early-stage research 
to high-volume, safety-critical production software. I am quite good 
at identifying the root-cause of problems and implementing methods to 
address them, whether they be technical, organizational or process-related. 
I have a life-long passion for applying simulation and automation to improve 
engineering quality and efficiency. With ever-increasing complexity 
in today's software, and not enough experienced engineers to produce 
them, I try to institutionalize test-oriented development culture to 
help engineers suceed in their jobs.

These days, I'm interested in following my passion for entrepreneurship
in software development to address important societal problems. If this 
sounds interesting, please feel free to reach out. When not working,
I enjoy spending time with my kids and watching them grow. Designing 
humans is full of faults, which makes it that much more enjoyable :wink:
