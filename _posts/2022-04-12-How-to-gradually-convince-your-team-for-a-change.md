Change is inevitable for an organization to grow and evolve.
If an organization does not change much, there is a good 
chance that your organization is dysfunctional or unable to
improve. However, change is also intrusive and uncomfortable by nature. 
When stakes are high, the most natural thing to do for leaders
is to stick to the methods that have worked in the past. As it is
often said, "If it ain't broken, don't fix it!" In some cases,
proposing a change can initially bring visibly negative impacts to 
the very problem that you are trying to solve by those changes. 
So how do we gracefully introduce a change to an engineering team,
when you know your ability to propose that change is somewhat limited?
  
I faced this challenge when proposing to migrate a unit test framework
within my team. Changes in tooling may seem trivial for some, but when
you are designing safety-critical, high-volume production software, any
small change in the infrastructure can lead to highly undesirable 
sequence of headaches. More importantly, switching the framework
meant throwing out at least some of the existing tests and having 
to rewrite them, while learning how to use it! -->
