Recently, I've been thinking a lot about what I would like 
to work on for the next 5 to 10 years, and began to notice a few things.
Growing up, I never used to keep a good record of my 
thoughts and ideas. In a sense, I liked the volatility of thoughts as they
flow through my mind and sometimes disappear out of thin air. Most 
would still stick around, so I didn't really have an issue. But as 
I got older and began to work more closely with other people,
I realized that keeping records of my thoughts can be highly beneficial.
It helps me organize my thoughts, reflect on it at another time, and
look at it from a third person's perspective.
  
So I decided to try blogging about some of the more lingering
thoughts I have on engineering and life in general. 
I am hoping that it would help me reflect on my journey when I look 
back in 15 to 20 years. So, onwards with the learning journal!
